# TeX Files
This is a repository for TeX style files and example documents. This code is used for two (main) reasons:
* to make syncing style files with Overleaf easier, and
* to help those interested in making style files of their own (or using mine).

I recommend using dylanadi, since a) it is the most versatile and b) I think it looks the best.
